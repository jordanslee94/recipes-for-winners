    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch of bananas</li>
        <li>1/2 lb of ham deli meat</li>
        <li>1 cup of hollandaise sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel bananas and place into a dish like a can of old sardines.</li>
        <li>Place ham deli meat upon the bananas, because why not.</li>
        <li>I have no idea how to make hollandaise sause, so hopefully you already have this lying around. Simply poor hollandaise over the top.</li>
        <li>If you still are following along (which you shouldnt be) bake dish at 350 degrees for 5 minutes. Any longer and the bananas will melt into a thick soup.</li>
        <li>Enjoy if possible!</li>
    </ol>
